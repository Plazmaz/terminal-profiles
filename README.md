# terminal-profiles
![demo.gif](./demo.gif)
My personal profiles for Windows Terminal. Color scheme is cyberpunk/cyberwave, inspired in part by [Cyberpunk-Neon](https://github.com/Roboron3042/Cyberpunk-Neon).  
`profiles-old.json` is for older versions of windows terminal before [cascading settings were introduced](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-preview-1910-release/).  
`profiles.json` was created for Windows Terminal >= 1910.  
The font used is [Noto Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/NotoMono/Noto%20Mono%20for%20Powerline.ttf)  
I was unable to find the source for the background image unfortunately. It seems to be used pretty widely.
